# Provider
* Providers are the receptionist. We are assuming that receptionist puts a computer on the counter of their office to allow incoming visitors to check into their appointments. Behind the desk, the receptionist has his or her own computer to manage their dashboard and visitor queue. This is the repo for that site.
